<h1>My Sakhii 🌸</h1>
<div class="subtitle">
Some bonds are not made by time — they are remembered by the soul.  
Just like Radha and Krishna.
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>Why You Matter 💖</h2>
<p>
Some people enter our lives softly, without noise or announcement,  
and yet their presence changes the way we breathe, think, and feel.  
You are that presence.
</p>
<p>
You matter not because you try to be important,  
but because your existence itself brings calm, honesty, and warmth.  
You listen without judging, stay without conditions,  
and understand without needing explanations.
</p>
<button onclick="toggleText('why')">Read deeper</button>
<div id="why" class="hidden">
<p>
In a world that constantly asks us to become more,  
you remind me that being real is enough.  
You make space for silence, for vulnerability, for truth.  
That kind of presence is rare — and priceless.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>Our Bond ✨</h2>
<p>
Our bond is not loud or demanding.  
It does not need daily proofs or constant words.  
It simply exists — steady, calm, and rooted.
</p>
<p>
Like the connection between Radha and Krishna,  
it flows beyond form, beyond labels, beyond expectations.  
It survives distance, time, and silence  
because it is built on understanding.
</p>
<button onclick="toggleText('bond')">What it means to me</button>
<div id="bond" class="hidden">
<p>
Some bonds are not about possession,  
they are about presence.  
Not about holding on tightly,  
but about knowing you’re never truly apart.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>Radha–Krishna Thought 🌿</h2>
<p class="quote">
“Radha didn’t walk beside Krishna everywhere,  
yet Krishna walked within her always.”
</p>
<p>
Radha–Krishna represent a love and friendship  
that is pure, selfless, and free from fear of loss.  
A connection that does not ask,  
but simply gives.
</p>
<button onclick="toggleText('rk')">Why this reminds me of you</button>
<div id="rk" class="hidden">
<p>
Some people become part of your inner world so deeply  
that even when they are not around,  
their presence guides you quietly.  
That is devotion. That is trust.  
That is you.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="card mood">
<h2>How Are You Feeling Today? 🌈</h2>
<button onclick="setMood('happy')">😊 Happy</button>
<button onclick="setMood('sad')">😔 Sad</button>
<button onclick="setMood('tired')">😴 Tired</button>
<button onclick="setMood('lost')">🌧️ Lost</button>
<div id="moodText" class="hidden"></div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>A Promise 🤍</h2>
<p>
This is not a momentary feeling,  
not something written for a phase of life.
</p>
<p>
It is a promise of constancy —  
like devotion that remains steady  
even when circumstances change.
</p>
<button onclick="toggleText('promise')">Read the promise</button>
<div id="promise" class="hidden">
<p>
I promise to stay —  
in your calm days and your chaotic ones,  
in your strength and your self-doubt,  
without trying to change you,  
without trying to own you.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="card">
<h2>One Last Note 🌙</h2>
<p>
If someday the world feels heavy,  
or you feel unseen or unheard,
</p>
<button onclick="toggleText('last')">Read slowly</button>
<div id="last" class="hidden">
<p>
remember this —  
someone somewhere thanks Krishna every day  
for your existence,  
for your kindness,  
for the light you bring without even realizing it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="footer">
🌸 Hare Krishna • Made with devotion by your Sakha 🌸
